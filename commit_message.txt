feat: Centralize database configuration and refactor authentication module

This commit introduces significant improvements to the database and authentication modules:

- **Database Module (`shared/database_base/`):
    - Integrated `secrets_manager` for dynamic `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL` configuration, enabling flexible deployment across environments.
    - Added dedicated unit tests for core CRUD operations and session management.
    - Created a comprehensive `README.md` for better documentation.
    - Added to `.geminiignore` to prevent unintended modifications by code assist tools.

- **Authentication Module (`shared/common/auth/`):
    - Updated to use OTP-based authentication flow, removing outdated password-based logic.
    - Resolved `role`/`roles` consistency issues across models and functions.
    - Added missing API routes (`/users/me/`, `/users/me/super-user-only/`, `/refresh-token`).
    - Refactored and updated `test_auth.py` to align with the new OTP flow and `roles` consistency.

- **Project Structure & Tooling:**
    - Removed the deprecated and unused `auth_service/` directory for cleaner project structure.
    - Organized authentication tests into `shared/tests/auth/` for better modularity.
    - Added a `pytest` pre-commit hook to enforce test pass before commits, enhancing code quality and protecting module architecture.
