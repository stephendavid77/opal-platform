# OpalSuite Shared Scripts

## Overview

The `shared/scripts/` module serves as a centralized repository for common build, deployment, and utility scripts that are applicable across the entire `OpalSuite` monorepo. Its purpose is to standardize repetitive tasks, automate workflows, and ensure consistency in operational procedures for all sub-applications and shared services.

## Architecture

This module is primarily a collection of executable scripts. Its architecture is defined by the organization and functionality of these scripts.

### 1. Script Categories

*   **Build Scripts:** Scripts for compiling code, bundling assets, or preparing applications for deployment (e.g., `build_all.sh`, `build_frontend.sh`).
*   **Deployment Scripts:** Scripts for deploying applications to various environments (e.g., `deploy_to_cloud_run.sh`, `update_k8s_config.sh`).
*   **Utility Scripts:** General-purpose scripts for common development or maintenance tasks (e.g., `clean_env.sh`, `run_tests.sh`, `check_architecture.py`).

### 2. Script Execution

*   Scripts are typically executed from the `OpalSuite` root directory or from within specific sub-application directories, depending on their scope.
*   They are designed to be idempotent where possible, meaning they can be run multiple times without causing unintended side effects.

### 3. Error Handling

*   Scripts should include robust error handling to fail gracefully and provide clear messages in case of issues.
*   They should exit with non-zero status codes upon failure to integrate effectively with CI/CD pipelines.

## How it Fits into OpalSuite

*   **Automation:** Automates repetitive tasks, reducing manual effort and potential for human error.
*   **Consistency:** Ensures that build, deployment, and operational procedures are consistent across all applications in the monorepo.
*   **Efficiency:** Centralizes common scripts, making them easily discoverable and reusable by all developers.
*   **CI/CD Integration:** Designed to be easily integrated into Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery pipelines.

## Getting Started (Development)

1.  **Explore Scripts:** Browse the scripts within this directory to understand available automation tasks.
2.  **Execution:** Execute scripts from the command line as needed. Refer to individual script headers for usage instructions.

## Future Enhancements

*   **Script Documentation:** Provide detailed documentation for each script, explaining its purpose, parameters, and usage.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Ensure scripts are compatible with different operating systems (e.g., using Python for cross-platform scripts).
*   **Parameterization:** Enhance scripts to accept parameters for greater flexibility.
*   **Centralized Logging:** Integrate script logging with a centralized logging solution.
