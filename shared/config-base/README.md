# OpalSuite Shared Configuration Base

## Overview

The `shared/config-base/` module serves as the central repository for shared configuration templates and schemas across the `OpalSuite` monorepo. Its primary purpose is to ensure consistency in configuration practices and to provide a single source of truth for common settings that might be used by multiple sub-applications or shared services.

## Architecture

This module is primarily a collection of files and does not contain executable code. Its architecture is defined by the organization and content of its configuration assets.

### 1. Configuration Templates

*   **Purpose:** Provides standardized templates for configuration files (e.g., `.env.example`, `config.yaml.template`) that sub-applications can copy and customize.
*   **Content:** These templates define the expected structure and types of configuration variables, making it easier for developers to set up new applications or integrate existing ones.

### 2. Configuration Schemas

*   **Purpose:** Defines formal schemas (e.g., using Pydantic or JSON Schema) for common configuration structures. This allows for validation of configuration files at runtime or during CI/CD processes.
*   **Content:** Schemas ensure that configuration data adheres to expected formats and types, preventing common errors related to misconfigured environments.

### 3. Environment Variable Definitions

*   **Purpose:** Documents and, where appropriate, provides default values or descriptions for environment variables that are critical for the operation of shared services or multiple sub-applications.
*   **Content:** This can include lists of required environment variables, their purpose, and examples.

## How it Fits into OpalSuite

*   **Consistency:** Enforces a consistent approach to configuration across the entire monorepo, reducing ambiguity and setup errors.
*   **Maintainability:** Centralizing common configuration elements simplifies updates and ensures that changes to shared settings are propagated effectively.
*   **Onboarding:** Provides clear guidelines and templates for new developers or when integrating new applications into the `OpalSuite` platform.

## Getting Started (Development)

Developers should refer to the files within this directory when setting up local development environments or configuring new deployments. Typically, you would copy relevant templates and fill in your specific values.

## Future Enhancements

*   **Automated Configuration Generation:** Tools to automatically generate configuration files based on schemas and environment variables.
*   **Configuration Validation Pipelines:** Integrate schema validation into CI/CD pipelines to catch misconfigurations early.
*   **Centralized Configuration Management System Integration:** Explore integration with external configuration management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Consul) for dynamic secret and configuration loading.
